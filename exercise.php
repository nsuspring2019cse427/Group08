        <h1>Exercise Facilities</h1>
        <p>Many adults aged 65 and over spend, on average, 10 hours or more each day sitting or lying down, making them the most sedentary age group.

They're paying a high price for their inactivity, with higher rates of falls, obesity, heart disease and early death compared with the general population.

As we get older, it becomes even more important to remain active if you want to stay healthy and maintain your independence.

If we don't stay active, all the things weâ€™ve always enjoyed doing and taken for granted may start to become that little bit harder.
This can all lead to being less able to look after yourself and do the things you enjoy. </p>

<p>
Our old care home ensures proper exercise facilities for our older citizens. Our older citizens are trained by professional trainers. And they also receive advice from experts regarding their exercise such as what will be the suitable exercise for them.
